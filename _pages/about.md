Hello! I am Chi, a data scientist passionate in data science application in the health domains. I have experiences leading data science and engineering teams and projects at scale in pharmacy innovation and pharmaceutical product commercialization. My quantitative strengths lie in statistics and machine learning (including experimentation methodology, value metrics design, productionalization of machine learning models in realtime A/B testing platform, uplift modeling, etc.). Most recently, I have been expanding my tech specs into natural language processing and deep learning. 


During graduate studies, I was an environmental health researcher and biostatistician. My research focuses have been applying statiscal modeling in environmental exposure and risk assessment. My doctoral dissertation was about linking sub-lethal pesticides exposure to honeybee colony collaspe disorder and human health.
