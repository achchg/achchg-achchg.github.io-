Hello! I am Chi, a data scientist in health domains. My quantitative strengths lie in statistics and machine learning (including experimentation methodology, value metrics design, productionalization of machine learning models in realtime A/B testing platform, uplift modeling, etc.). Most recently, I have been expanding my tech specs into natural language processing and deep learning. 


I'm experienced in leading data science and engineering teams and projects at scale. Specifically, machine learning in pharmacy innovation and pharmaceutical product commercialization software development. During graduate studies, I was an environmental health researcher and biostatistician. My research focuses have been applying statiscal modeling in environmental exposure and risk assessment. My doctoral dissertation was about linking sub-lethal pesticides exposure to honeybee colony collaspe disorder (CCD) and human health.
