Hello! I am Chi, a hands-on emerging data science leader with 10+ years data experience in academia and industry. My quantitative strengths lie in statistics and machine learning (including experimentation methodologies, value metric designs, productionalization of machine learning models on realtime A/B testing platform, uplift modeling, bayesian statistical modeling, etc.). Most recently, I have been expanding my tech specs into natural language processing and deep learning. 


I'm experienced in leading data science teams and projects in:
-  promoting healthcare/retail experimentation + ML personalization (e.g. omnichannel, content, timing optimization)
-  identifying higher-value customer segments with propensity and uplift scores
-  developing campaign performance measurement framework with frequentist/bayesian methods
-  selecting patient cohort with ICD-10 code logics and machine learning
-  scaling software development (front + backend) of forecasting models on a cloud platform

During graduate studies, I was an environmental health researcher and biostatistician at Harvard focused on environmental pesiticide exposure and health risk simulation with statistical models. My doctoral [dissertation](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37945631/CHANG-DISSERTATION-2018.pdf?sequence=3) was about linking sub-lethal pesticides exposure to honeybee colony collaspe disorder (CCD) and human health.
