Continuing from yesterday's post, documenting an example word2vec notebook using [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html). Here, I went for a super basic example with the following steps:
- Queried the keyword `Neonicotinoids` from `pymed`, a python-based PubMed API. Set the maximum query size as 5000
- Used the lower-cased keywords of the articles as the sentence for training word2vec word embeddings
- Built both a CBOW and a Skip-gram model and checked how the word vectors differed for one single word vector (`imidacloprid`)
- Printed out the top 10 similar word vector to `imidacloprid` under both methods


Detail example and citation of part of the example codes can be found in my notebook [here](https://github.com/achchg/achchg.github.io/blob/master/jupyternb/2022-09-25-word2vec.ipynb).
